# Git & GitHub Basics

### Setting Up Git

Configure username

```
git config --global user.name your_username_here
```

Configure email address

```
git config --global user.email your_email_address_here
```

To check your current username and email configuration

```
git config user.name
git config user.email
```

If you wish to not expose your email address when you commit on GitHub, a `noreply` email address can be used for this purpose.
Visit https://github.com/settings/emails and check the `Keep my email addresses private` option, now from here you can use the `noreply`
email directly if you are using through website or if you are using command line git tool, you can easily set your `noreply` email using the
config command above.
